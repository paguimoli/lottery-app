# Lottery/Keno Database Architecture & Hardening Blueprint v1.0

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the production database architecture and hardening blueprint for the Lottery/Keno platform before implementing final ticket acceptance, settlement, wallet enforcement, audit logging, anti-manipulation controls, integrity hashes, and signing.

This is a design blueprint only. It does not define executable migrations.

## 2. Architecture Principles

The production data model should enforce these principles at the database boundary:

- Critical financial records are append-only.
- Accepted tickets are immutable.
- Official results are immutable after posting.
- Corrections use explicit correction, reversal, or superseding records.
- Hierarchy moves require audit trails.
- Settlement is idempotent and versioned.
- Every sensitive admin action is auditable.
- Every major domain record has stable foreign keys.
- Integrity hashing is introduced before public/private signing.
- Signing is deferred until the schema is stable.

## 3. Accounts / Hierarchy

### Tables

- `accounts`
- `account_hierarchy_events`

### `accounts`

Purpose: stores all operational accounts in a single hierarchy.

Core fields:

- `id`
- `account_type`: `super_master`, `master_agent`, `agent`, `player`
- `parent_id`
- `username`
- `display_name`
- `email`
- `phone`
- `market_id`
- `language`
- `currency`
- `status`
- `cash_balance_snapshot`
- `credit_limit`
- `allocated_credit`
- `current_exposure`
- `max_bet`
- `max_payout`
- `notes`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

Hierarchy rules:

- `super_master` cannot have a parent.
- `super_master` may contain `master_agent` accounts.
- `master_agent` may have a parent of `super_master` or `master_agent`.
- `master_agent` may contain `master_agent` and `agent` accounts.
- `agent` must have a `master_agent` parent.
- `agent` may contain `player` accounts only.
- `player` must have an `agent` parent.
- `player` is terminal and cannot contain children.
- Circular hierarchy references must be blocked.

Uniqueness:

- `username` must be globally unique, case-insensitive.
- Username uniqueness is global across the platform, not scoped to agent, master, player, market, or operator.
- This prevents ambiguity across agent hierarchy navigation, PAM integrations, statements, audit logs, support workflows, and account recovery.

Downline visibility:

- `super_master` sees the entire network.
- `master_agent` sees descendants only.
- `agent` sees direct players only.
- `player` sees own account only.
- Backend queries must resolve downline access server-side. UI filtering is not sufficient.

### `account_hierarchy_events`

Purpose: immutable audit trail for hierarchy changes.

Core fields:

- `id`
- `account_id`
- `old_parent_id`
- `new_parent_id`
- `old_account_type`
- `new_account_type`
- `changed_by_admin_user_id`
- `reason_code`
- `reason_note`
- `created_at`

Rules:

- Insert only.
- Never update or delete hierarchy event records.
- Every parent reassignment must create a row.
- Production workflows should require reason codes for moving accounts with descendants.

## 4. Markets

### Tables

- `markets`

### `markets`

Purpose: lightweight localization and operating defaults. Markets are not regulatory/geofencing controls.

Core fields:

- `weekly_reset_time`
- `weekly_reset_time_zone`
- `active`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

Rules:

- `code` must be unique.
- `time_zone` and `weekly_reset_time_zone` must use IANA time zone names, for example `America/Costa_Rica`.
- Weekly reset fields drive future zero-balance processes.

## 5. Games / Drawings / Results

### Tables

### Integrity Notes

Reserved fields where applicable:

- `record_hash`
- `previous_hash`
- `signature`
- `signature_key_id`

## 13. Integrity & Security Fields

Reserved fields for critical tables:

- `record_hash`
- `previous_hash`
- `signature`
- `signature_key_id`
- `signature_version`
- `signed_at`

Critical tables:

- `tickets`
- `ticket_lines`
- `ledger_transactions`
- `drawing_results`
- `rng_requests`
- `rng_results`
- `settlement_runs`
- `settlement_records`
- `audit_logs`
- `account_hierarchy_events`

Hardening sequence:

1. Add stable schema and constraints first.
2. Add deterministic record hashing.
3. Add hash chaining where sequence matters.
4. Add public/private signing later in Phase 4.8.

Signing should happen after schema stability because signatures must cover stable canonical payloads. Changing signed fields after deployment creates verification and replay complexity.

Hashing strategy:

- Ledger transactions use hash chaining.
- Settlement records use hash chaining.
- Official results use hash chaining.
- Tickets use individual record hashes at acceptance.

Reason:

- Ledger, settlement, and official result records are sequential tamper-sensitive records.
- Tickets are immutable once accepted and should be individually hashed at the acceptance boundary.
- Public/private signing remains Phase 4.8, near the end of pre-production hardening, because signing depends on stable final schemas and canonical payload formats.

## 14. Database Constraints

Required constraints:

- Unique case-insensitive `accounts.username`.
- Valid account hierarchy parent rules.
- No circular account hierarchy.
- Unique `markets.code`.
- Unique `games.code` per market/operator scope.
- Unique `drawings.draw_code`.
- Unique `tickets.ticket_number`.
- Unique ticket idempotency key.
- One active paytable for the same game, wager type, and effective period.
- One completed settlement per drawing.
- Unique RNG request idempotency key.
- Foreign keys between all major records.
- No ticket edits after accepted.
- No ticket acceptance after cutoff.
- No result edits after official posting.
- No duplicate settlement.
- Ledger transactions append-only.
- No update/delete for ledger transactions.
- No update/delete for audit logs.
- No update/delete for hierarchy events.
- Resettlement requires override authorization.
- Financial corrections use reversal transactions.

Implementation notes:

- Append-only rules should be enforced with database permissions and triggers.
- Status transitions should be constrained by controlled functions or API workflows.
- Critical mutations should use stored procedures or transactional application services.

## 17. Locked Production Decisions

### Username Uniqueness Scope

Decision: usernames are globally unique across the platform.

Reason: global uniqueness prevents ambiguity across agents, masters, players, PAM integrations, statements, audit logs, support workflows, and account recovery.

### Ticket Idempotency Scope

Decision: ticket acceptance must use a ticket idempotency key enforced by the database.

Reason: idempotency prevents duplicate tickets from retries, double-clicks, network failures, PAM retries, or API replay.

Implementation note: the exact key composition may include external ticket id, source system, account, and organization context, but the production rule is that ticket acceptance must be uniquely idempotent.

### Settlement Execution Boundary

Decision: settlement is executed per drawing.

Only one completed settlement run may exist per drawing unless a controlled resettlement override is authorized.

Reason: this prevents duplicate settlement and duplicate ledger entries.

### Paytable Uniqueness

Decision: only one active paytable may exist for the same game, wager type, and effective period.

Reason: this prevents settlement ambiguity.

### Hash Chaining Strategy

Decision:

- Ledger transactions use hash chaining.
- Settlement records use hash chaining.
- Official results use hash chaining.
- Tickets use individual record hashes at acceptance.

Reason: ledger, settlement, and official results are sequential tamper-sensitive records. Tickets are immutable once accepted and should be individually hashed.

### Public/Private Signing

Decision: public/private signing remains Phase 4.8, near the end of pre-production hardening.

Reason: signing depends on stable final schemas and canonical payload formats.

### Reserved Integrity Fields

Decision: reserve these fields where applicable:

- `record_hash`
- `previous_hash`
- `signature`
- `signature_key_id`
- `signature_version`
- `signed_at`

### Anti-Manipulation Rules

Decision: production hardening must explicitly enforce these rules:

- No ticket edits after acceptance.
- No ticket acceptance after cutoff.
- No direct result edits after official posting.
- No duplicate settlement.
- No ledger update/delete.
- Resettlement requires override authorization.
- Financial corrections use reversal transactions.
