# Ledger Authority Approval Runbook

## Purpose

This runbook describes how operators review and record Ledger authority approvals.

Ledger approval workflows are append-only and auditable. They do not change authority by themselves.

## Current Phase

Phase 16.4 supports Ledger dry-run approval capture, promotion approval capture, simulation-only controlled promotion/rollback evaluation, and explicit controlled promotion execution.

## Preconditions

Before recording Ledger dry-run approval, confirm:

- Ledger authority is `MONOLITH`.
- Ledger comparison mode is `ENABLED`.
- Ledger rollback readiness is `READY`.
- Ledger promotion decision is `READY_FOR_DRY_RUN_APPROVAL`.
- Ledger promotion evidence is `READY`.
- Raw evidence warnings have been reviewed.

Before recording Ledger promotion approval, also confirm:

- Ledger `DRY_RUN_APPROVAL` exists.
- Ledger promotion decision is `READY_FOR_PROMOTION_APPROVAL`.
- Ledger authority is still `MONOLITH`.
- Ledger comparison mode is still `ENABLED`.
- Rollback readiness is still `READY`.

## Review Commands

```bash
npm run ops:ledger-authority-readiness
npm run ops:ledger-promotion-decision
npm run ops:ledger-dry-run-evaluation
```

## Dry-Run Approval Command

```bash
npm run ops:approve-ledger-dry-run -- \
  --justification "Reviewed Ledger shadow evidence and rollback readiness." \
  --acknowledge-warning "Raw evidence is not READY and must remain visible for review." \
  --acknowledge-warning "DRY_RUN_APPROVAL is missing." \
  --acknowledge-warning "PROMOTION_APPROVAL is missing."
```

## Promotion Approval Command

```bash
npm run ops:approve-ledger-promotion -- \
  --justification "Reviewed Ledger dry-run approval, rollback readiness, and controlled promotion readiness." \
  --acknowledge-warning "Raw evidence is not READY and must remain visible for review." \
  --acknowledge-warning "PROMOTION_APPROVAL is missing."
```

## What Dry-Run Approval Does

Dry-run approval:

- Records an append-only `DRY_RUN_APPROVAL` for `LEDGER`.
- Captures actor and justification.
- Emits `authority.ledger.dry_run.approved`.
- Advances Ledger decision to promotion approval readiness.

Dry-run approval does not:

- Promote Ledger.
- Route ledger posting to Ledger Service.
- Change financial posting logic.
- Change balances.
- Disable comparison or rollback.

## What Promotion Approval Does

Promotion approval:

- Records an append-only `PROMOTION_APPROVAL` for `LEDGER`.
- Captures actor and justification.
- Emits `authority.ledger.promotion.approved`.
- Advances Ledger decision to `READY_FOR_CONTROLLED_PROMOTION`.

Promotion approval does not:

- Promote Ledger.
- Change `LEDGER_AUTHORITY`.
- Route ledger posting to Ledger Service.
- Change balances.
- Change financial posting logic.
- Disable comparison or rollback.

## Next Operator Action

After promotion approval, run Ledger promotion simulation and rollback simulation before any controlled promotion phase.

## Promotion Simulation Command

```bash
npm run ops:simulate-ledger-promotion
```

Promotion simulation verifies:

- Ledger decision is `READY_FOR_CONTROLLED_PROMOTION`.
- Ledger rollback readiness is `READY`.
- Ledger authority is `MONOLITH`.
- Ledger comparison mode is `ENABLED`.
- Ledger Service health is available.

Promotion simulation emits `authority.ledger.promotion.simulated`.

Promotion simulation does not:

- change `LEDGER_AUTHORITY`;
- route ledger posting to Ledger Service;
- change balances;
- change ledger posting logic;
- promote Ledger.

## Rollback Simulation Command

```bash
npm run ops:simulate-ledger-rollback
```

Rollback simulation verifies:

- monolith ledger path is available;
- comparison mode is enabled;
- authority controls are available;
- rollback readiness is `READY`.

Rollback simulation emits `authority.ledger.rollback.simulated`.

Rollback simulation does not:

- change `LEDGER_AUTHORITY`;
- execute rollback;
- modify approvals;
- mutate financial records.

## Controlled Promotion Command

```bash
npm run ops:ledger-promote -- \
  --justification "Reviewed Ledger controlled promotion readiness and rollback readiness." \
  --correlation-id "operator-selected-correlation-id"
```

Promotion execution requires:

- `domain = LEDGER`;
- explicit `mode = EXECUTE`;
- non-empty justification;
- Ledger decision is `READY_FOR_CONTROLLED_PROMOTION`;
- Ledger rollback readiness is `READY`;
- Ledger authority is `MONOLITH`;
- Ledger comparison mode is `ENABLED`;
- Ledger Service health is available;
- Ledger dry-run and promotion approvals exist.

When valid, promotion execution:

- changes runtime Ledger authority to `SERVICE`;
- keeps Ledger comparison mode `ENABLED`;
- keeps Settlement `SERVICE`;
- keeps Credit `MONOLITH`;
- emits `authority.ledger.promoted`;
- records actor, justification, approval id, correlation id, and timestamp.

If Ledger is already `SERVICE`, the command is idempotent and does not emit a duplicate promotion event.

The operations script persists these local runtime settings to `.env.local`:

```text
LEDGER_AUTHORITY=SERVICE
LEDGER_COMPARISON_MODE=ENABLED
```

No unrelated `.env.local` values are changed.

## Promotion Status Command

```bash
npm run ops:ledger-promotion-status
```

The status output includes:

- domain;
- authority;
- comparison mode;
- promoted timestamp;
- rollback readiness;
- promotion approval id;
- evaluation timestamp.

## Rollback Sequence

Ledger rollback execution is not part of Phase 16.4. Until rollback execution support exists, operators should:

1. Run `npm run ops:rollback-readiness`.
2. Run `npm run ops:simulate-ledger-rollback`.
3. Follow the incident runbook before changing runtime authority.
4. Preserve comparison mode and append-only audit evidence.

## Post-Promotion Validation

After controlled promotion, verify:

- Ledger authority is `SERVICE`.
- Ledger comparison mode remains `ENABLED`.
- Settlement remains `SERVICE` and `CERTIFIED`.
- Credit remains `MONOLITH`.
- rollback readiness remains `READY`.
- credit launch QA passes.
- worker observability QA passes.

## Post-Promotion Monitoring

Run:

```bash
npm run ops:ledger-post-promotion-status
```

Review:

- authority and comparison mode;
- promotion timestamp;
- Ledger Service health;
- rollback readiness;
- raw, promotion, and post-promotion evidence summaries;
- post-promotion mismatch and failure counts;
- rollback trigger source;
- operator recommendation.

Raw evidence remains visible for audit. Rollback trigger evaluation must use lifecycle-effective promotion and post-promotion evidence so excluded QA evidence does not independently trigger rollback.

## Rollback Drill

Run:

```bash
npm run ops:simulate-ledger-rollback-drill
```

The drill is simulation-only. It must not change authority, routing, balances, or ledger posting behavior.

Expected passing output:

- `drillPassed = true`
- `authorityBefore = SERVICE`
- `authorityAfter = SERVICE`
- `authorityChanged = false`
- audit event `authority.ledger.rollback.drill.simulated`

Escalate if:

- Ledger Service health is unavailable;
- rollback readiness is not `READY`;
- comparison mode is disabled;
- the drill reports an authority change;
- lifecycle-effective post-promotion mismatches or failures appear.
